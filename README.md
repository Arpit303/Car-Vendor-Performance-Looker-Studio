# Vendor Performance : A Comprehensive Analysis 

Vendor performance analysis is a critical component of maintaining operational excellence and ensuring service quality in any organization. Effective vendor performance analysis not only helps in identifying areas where vendors excel but also highlights potential inefficiencies and areas for improvement. By leveraging data on service start times, slot times, delays, and other performance indicators, organizations can gain valuable insights into their vendors' reliability and efficiency.  

This analysis supports informed decision-making, fosters stronger vendor relationships, and drives continuous improvement in service delivery. Ultimately, a robust vendor performance analysis framework contributes to enhanced customer satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and competitive advantage in the marketplace.

Data Collection and Preparation :
In our analysis, we utilized data comprising service start times, slot times, and delays. Service start times indicate the actual commencement of services, slot times represent the scheduled times for these services, and delays measure the difference between the scheduled slot times and the actual start times. Assumptions made during data preparation included treating minor variations in times due to clock discrepancies as negligible and assuming that the provided slot times were accurate representations of the scheduled service times.
